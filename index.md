Welcome to my personal website. I'm currently studying for a PhD under the supervision of Professor [Carl Dettmann](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~macpd/). We are working on understanding the Shannon entropy of Soft Random Geometric Graph ensembles. Please visit the 'research' section for a deeper explanation.

I am a part of [COMPASS](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/cdt/compass/) Centre for Doctoral Training in Computational Statistics and Data Science at the Univeristy of Bristol.
