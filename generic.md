There are many models of random graphs, however most of them do not incorporate a spatial aspect in the process. The Random Geometric Graph (RGG) achieves this by modelling a random network as follows:

1. Distribute points according to a point process (usually Poisson or Binomial) in some space.
2. Connect the points according to a connection function $p$ which is dependent on the pairwise distance of the points.
